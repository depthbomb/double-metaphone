# @depthbomb/double-metaphone

This is a pure TypeScript fork of [double-metaphone](https://github.com/words/double-metaphone) as a library only (no CLI included) that also supports both ESM and CJS, because it _really_ isn't that hard.

The API hasn't changed so you can refer to the [original documentation of the library](https://github.com/words/double-metaphone) for usage.
